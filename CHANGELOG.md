This release brings several breaking changes throughout the codebase as we continue the transition from Objective-C to Swift, and as we start adopting structured concurrency.

The Airship SDK now requires iOS 14+ as the minimum deployment version and Xcode 14.3+

### Changes
- Added support for Stories, a new format for Scenes
- Added support for In-App experiences downstream of a sequence in Journeys
- Updated minimum deployment version to iOS 14
- Message Center module has been rewritten in Swift
- The provided Message Center UI has been rewritten in Swift & SwiftUI

## Version 16.11.0 February 22, 2023
Minor release that fixes a potential channel restore issue on second run. The impact should be small since the channel create will return the same channel ID if the app has a device token or the app installed the Message Center module. 

### Changes
- Fixed app restore detection false positive on second run
- Added new optional `PushNotificationDelegate` method `extendPresentationOptions(_:notification:completionHandler)` that allows returning foreground presentation options with a callback instead of synchronously
- Added new `Config` method `validate(logIssues:)` to prevent logging on the config.

- Fixed logging live activities update as an error instead of debug

## Version 16.10.0-beta October 6, 2022

Beta release for SDK 16.10.0 that adds support for live activities. To support live activities, you must call restore once after takeOff during `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` with all the live activity types that you
might track with Airship:

```
  Airship.takeOff(config, launchOptions: launchOptions)

  Task {
      await Airship.channel.restoreLiveActivityTracking { restorer in
          await restorer.restore(
            forType: Activity<DeliveryAttributes>.self
          )
          await restorer.restore(
            forType: Activity<SomeOtherAttributes>.self
          )
      }
  }
```

Then whenever you want Airship to track an activity, call trackLiveActivity on the channel instance with the name of the activity:

```
  Task {
      await Airship.channel.trackLiveActivity(
          activity,
          name: "my-neat-activity"
      )
  }
```

You will then be able to send updates through the Airship Push API to the live activity using the name `my-neat-activity`.

The majority of apps will only be effected by the new `UAURLAllowList` behavior changes.

### Changes
- **BEHAVIOR CHANGE** All URLs are not verified by default. Applications that use open URL action, landing pages, and custom in-app message image URLs will need to provide a list of URL patterns that match those URLs for SCOPE_OPEN_URL.

- Channel Capture tool now detects a `knock` of 6 app opens in 30 seconds. Instead of displaying anything to the user, the tool will write the current channel ID to the clipboard.
- `UAWhitelist` class and terminology removed and replaced with `UAURLAllowList`.
- `UAActionAutomation` class and functionality has been moved to `UAInAppAutomation`, which covers both Action Automation and In-App Messages.
- In-App Automation APIs have been updated to support future IAA enhancements.

but as of SDK 13 it is now possible to create custom integrations by selecting
feature modules. Most of the changes in this release reflect the restructuring that
makes this possible.

### Changes
- Modularized the SDK. For breaking API changes, see the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/urbanairship/ios-library/tree/main/Documentation/Migration).
- Replaced `AirshipKit` with `Airship`.
- Replaced `AirshipLocationKit` with `AirshipLocation`. `AirshipLocation` is not compatible with with `Airship` framework installation (xcframeworks or Carthage), and must be used with the core SDK and explicit feature modules
- Added new `Airship` podspec that replaces both `UrbanAirship-iOS-SDK` and `UrbanAirship-iOS-Location`. `Airship` podspec now contains subspecs for `Core`, `Automation`, `MessageCenter`, `Location`, and `ExtendedActions` to make it possible to only specify which Airship features to use.
- Added podspec `AirshipExtensions` that replaces `UrbanAirship-iOS-AppExtensions`. The new podspec contains subspecs for `NotificationContent` and `NotificationService`.

### Note for apps that directly schedule In-App Messages using the SDK
Some apps may be using the `UAInAppMessageManager`'s `scheduleMessageWithScheduleInfo` or `scheduleMessagesWithScheduleInfo` methods to directly schedule In-App messages through the SDK.
The first time the app runs with this version of the SDK, any In-App Messages that were directly scheduled
by the app will be canceled and removed. The app will need to re-schedule those messages.

Apps whose in-app messages are scheduled only through the Airship message composers (go.urbanairship.com) don't need to take any additional action after upgrading to this version.

Major release required for new in-app messaging capabilities.

### Changes
- In-app messaging v2. The new in-app messaging module includes several different view types
that are fully configurable, including modal, banner, and fullscreen. An in-app message is able to
be triggered using the same rules as the Action automation module.
- Automation schedule priority: Used to determine the execution order of schedules if multiple
schedules are triggered by the same event.
- Support for editing automation schedules.
- New active session automation trigger. The trigger will increment its count if it has been scheduled
during an active session instead of waiting for the next foreground.
- New app version automation trigger. The trigger will increment its count if the app has been updated to
a specified version.
- Extended whitelist URL checking for URL loading instead of just JS bridge injection. By default these
checks are disabled, but you can enable them with the AirshipConfigOptions field enableUrlWhitelisting.
- A rate app action to prompt the user to rate the application.
- Updated localizations.
- Removed deprecated code. Please see [Migration Guide](Documentation/Migration/Migration%20Guide.md#urban-airship-library-8x-to-90).

### New Features
- Full support for iOS 8, including compatibility with Swift applications.
- Includes an Embedded.framework for use in applications with a minimum SDK version of 8.0.
- Includes support for interactive notifications and the new iOS 8 notification registration model.
  - Includes more than 25 built-in interactive notification sets, including button resources
    for 9 languages.
  - Additional/replacement localization strings may be added to built-in actions.
- Includes a new action for social sharing that can be called from pushes or web views.
- Includes support for defining custom events in our reporting system.
- Background push can now be used without an opt-in prompt (request remote-notification
  background type in your Info.plist).
- The inbox now stores local state for read/delete. The UI no longer needs to block while
  updates are made.
- Inbox core data operations are now performed on a background queue.

### Major API Changes
- User notifications (badge, alert, sound) now default to OFF. This change is designed to
  make it easier to prompt for permission in the right spot. If you were relying on the
  old default (push enabled at start), you will need to update your registration logic.
- Supports iOS 6+. (Support for iOS 5 has been removed).
- UA location now handles iOS8-style authorization. Once location reporting is started and
  an authorization prompt is presented, changes to the authorization level are not possible
  without updating the app in the App Store. By default, "always" authorization will be requested.
  To request "when in use" set the property 'requestAlwaysAuthorization' to NO on UALocationService.
- Replaced existing tag modifiers on UAPush with more concisely named methods: addTag, addTags,
  removeTag, and removeTags.
- FOR DETAILED INFO: http://docs.urbanairship.com/topic_guides/ios_migration.html

### Sample UI Changes
- Removed UAInboxUI and UAPushUI protocols. Sample code now displays views directly.
- Refactored the localization in both sample projects.
- Moved sample resources to a new common folder (including those used in the interactive
  notifications).
- Sample projects now include targets that use the embedded framework (static library
  still used in the original targets).

### General Modernization
- Modernized init and factory methods. All now return `instancetype` rather than `id` or
  concrete classes.
- NS_ENUM and NS_OPTIONS are now used throughout.
- Removed previously deprecated methods and classes.
- Removed use of methods deprecated in iOS 6 (now that iOS 5 support has been dropped).

### Documentation Updates
- The SDK distribution now includes the API reference documentation in the `reference-docs` folder.
- The generated (header) documentation (in reference-docs) now has complete coverage of our public interface,
  including enums and block types.

## 4.0.4 - September 10, 2014
 - Fixed iOS 8 push prompt on first-run and immediate opt-out.
 - Fixed quiet time setting not persisting between application restarts.
 - Added work around for iOS 8 registration bug where disabling push registering prevents registering for notification types
   without a device restart. Instead of registering for 0 notification types, the device will just be marked as opted-out. This only
   affects newer iOS 8 devices. For more information, see the documentation for allowUnregisteringUserNotificationTypes on UAPush.
 - UA location is now compatible with iOS 8 authorization modes. If building against Xcode 6, make sure to add the new authorization
   keys (NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription and NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription) to the application's info.plist. You must also manually
   request the correct authorization before starting location on Urban Airship by calling either requestWhenInUseAuthorization or requestAlwaysAuthorization on CLLocationManager.

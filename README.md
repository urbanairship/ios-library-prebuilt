services into your iOS applications.

## Installation

Xcode 15.2+ is required to use the Airship SDK.

### CocoaPods

Make sure you have the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) dependency manager installed. You can do so by executing the following command:

```sh
$ gem install cocoapods
```

The primary Airship pod includes all subspecs and is advisable to use for most use cases.

Example podfile:

```txt
# Airship SDK
target "<Your Target Name>" do
  pod 'Airship'
end
```

The `Airship` pod also contains several subspecs that can be installed
independently and in combination with one another when only a particular
selection of functionality is desired:

- `Airship/Core` : Push messaging features including channels, tags, named user and default actions
- `Airship/MessageCenter` : Message center
- `Airship/Automation` : Automation and in-app messaging
- `Airship/PreferenceCenter` : Preference center
- `Airship/FeatureFlags` : Feature flags

Example podfile:

```txt
target "<Your Target Name>" do
  pod 'Airship/Core'
  pod 'Airship/MessageCenter'
  pod 'Airship/Automation'
end
```

Install using the following command:
```sh
$ pod install
```

In order to take advantage of notification attachments, you will need to create a notification service extension
alongside your main application. Most of the work is already done for you, but since this involves creating a new target there
are a few additional steps. First create a new "Notification Service Extension" target. Then add AirshipExtensions/NotificationService
to the new target:

```txt
# Airship SDK
target "<Your Service Extension Target Name>" do
  pod 'AirshipServiceExtension'
end
```

Install using the following command:

```sh
$ pod install
```

Then delete all the dummy source code for the new extension and have it inherit from UANotificationServiceExtension:

```
import AirshipServiceExtension

class NotificationService: UANotificationServiceExtension {

}
```

### Other Installation Methods

For other installation methods, see the - [Getting started guide](http://docs.airship.com/platform/ios.html#installation).

## Quickstart

### Capabilities

Enable Push Notifications and Remote Notifications Background mode under the capabilities section for
the main application target.

### Adding an Airship Config File

The library uses a .plist configuration file named `AirshipConfig.plist` to manage your production and development
application profiles. Example copies of this file are available in all of the sample projects. Place this file
in your project and set the following values to the ones in your application at http://go.urbanairship.com.  To
view all the possible keys and values, see the [AirshipConfig class reference](https://docs.airship.com/reference/libraries/ios/latest/AirshipCore/Classes/AirshipConfig.html)

You can also edit the file as plain-text:

```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
      <key>detectProvisioningMode</key>
      <true/>
      <key>developmentAppKey</key>
      <string>Your Development App Key</string>
      <key>developmentAppSecret</key>
      <string>Your Development App Secret</string>
      <key>productionAppKey</key>
      <string>Your Production App Key</string>
      <key>productionAppSecret</key>
      <string>Your Production App Secret</string>
    </dict>
    </plist>
```

The library will auto-detect the production mode when setting `detectProvisioningMode` to `true`.

Advanced users may add scripting or preprocessing logic to this .plist file to automate the switch from
development to production keys based on the build type.

### Call Takeoff

To enable push notifications, you will need to make several additions to your application delegate.

```
func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    ...

    Airship.takeOff(launchOptions: launchOptions)

    return true
}
```

To enable push later on in your application:

```
    // Somewhere in the app, this will enable push (setting it to NO will disable push,
    // which will trigger the proper registration or de-registration code in the library).
    Airship.push.userPushNotificationsEnabled = true
```
